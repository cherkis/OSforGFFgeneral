# Modified Bessel function `K₁`

Defines the modified Bessel function of the second kind of order one through its cosh integral
representation. The radial profile of the free covariance in four dimensions is `(m/(4π²r)) K₁(mr)`
(`Instances/Dim4.lean`). The proper-time (Schwinger) evaluation
`∫₀^∞ (1/t²) e^{-m²t - r²/(4t)} dt = (4m/r) K₁(mr)` is the order-one case of the master identity
`schwingerIntegral_eq_besselK` (`General/BesselK`).

The `K₁` analytic lemmas (positivity, continuity, the asymptotic and near-origin bounds, radial
integrability) supported the original four-dimensional analysis and are preserved off the build
graph in `OSforGFF/Legacy/BesselK1Analytics.lean`.
